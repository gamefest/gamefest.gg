First organized as a LAN party in 1994, DreamHack has grown into a gaming lifestyle festival offering big expos, live music, cosplay, streamers, esports tournaments, and more. In 2019, the DreamHack festival tour consists of eleven festivals spanning eight countries and three continents.

Coming November 15-17, DreamHack Atlanta is a three-day event with everything gaming under one roof. The event will feature all the core content you've come to expect of a DreamHack festival, plus many more new activities that fit your way of life.
