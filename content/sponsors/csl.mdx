Back in 2009 CSL started off at a college dorm; our vision, to bring gaming communities together. One school at a time, CSL grew to become the worldâ€™s largest collegiate esports league. Today, thanks to you, over 55,000 students and 1,800 schools are enrolled in our Leagues.

This is just the beginning, a glance at what we are building for you at CSL. We want you to be part of the journey, so join us today!
