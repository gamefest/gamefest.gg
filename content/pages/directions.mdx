## Venue

This year, Gamefest is being hosted in the [Klaus Advanced Computing Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Advanced_Computing_Building) at Georgia Tech, a three-story academic building that houses a portion of the College of Computing, College of Engineering, and related programs. The building houses cutting edge computing research, with a 500-square-foot data center in the building providing 80 kilowatts of power and cooling capacity for critical enterprise servers. The building's advanced infrastructure provides 1 Gpbs networking to all ports with a 10 Gbps uplink to the campus network as well as high-density 802.11n wireless networking support.

The unique electrical and networking infrastructure makes the Klaus Building a perfect place to host a LAN event, making sure that power and latency are never an issue. **Each BYOC tournament seat comes with one ethernet port and one power port to power your computer setup**, though **a power splitter may be necessary to power a combined monitor+computer setup.**

### Parking

Parking can be found at one of the nearby visitor parking areas (marked on the map). These parking spaces may require payment to park, and may be full. **There is a Georgia Tech home football game on Saturday, November 2nd, so parking may be limited, especially in the southern parking location**.

For Georgia Tech students with parking passes, the Klaus building parking deck may be open over the weekend without restriction.
